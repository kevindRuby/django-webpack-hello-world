# django-webpack-hello-world

Learn webpack with a simple 1 page Hello World django app website that has 1 image.jpg file, 1 main.html file, 1 main.js file that makes the text blink and 1 main.css using ONLY a github remote repo and github Codespaces (i.e. no local github repo).  The structure is setup so that if another Django app folder is setu that it will use the current python and django venv of this example


# How to test the speed benefits gained from using Webpack in your Django app, you can follow these steps:

### 1. **Measure Load Time Before and After Webpack**

1. **Before Adding Webpack:**
   - First, serve your Django app without Webpack (if you had any static files directly included in your templates before using Webpack).
   - Open the browser's developer tools (usually by pressing `F12`).
   - Go to the **Network** tab and refresh the page.
   - Check the **Load** time displayed in the **Network** tab for the files being loaded (especially your JavaScript and CSS files). Note down the time taken to load the page and any specific assets.

2. **After Adding Webpack:**
   - Now, make sure youâ€™re using the bundled files generated by Webpack in your HTML (i.e., your `<script>` and `<link>` tags should refer to the `bundle.js` and your CSS file).
   - Refresh the page again with Webpack enabled, and monitor the load times in the **Network** tab.
   - Compare the load times with the previous results.

### 2. **Use Performance Monitoring Tools**

You can also use tools like:

- **Lighthouse (Built into Chrome DevTools)**:
  - Open your Django app in Chrome.
  - Go to the **Lighthouse** tab in the developer tools.
  - Generate a report by clicking **Generate report**.
  - Review the performance score, load times, and suggestions for improvement.

- **WebPageTest**:
  - Go to [WebPageTest](https://www.webpagetest.org/).
  - Enter your app's URL and start the test.
  - Analyze the detailed results, including load time, resource loading waterfall, and performance scores.

### 3. **Compare Bundle Size**

You can check the size of your JavaScript files before and after using Webpack. A smaller bundle size can significantly improve load times:

- In your `webpack.config.js`, add the `stats` option to output the bundle size:

  ```javascript
  const path = require('path');

  module.exports = {
      //... existing config
      stats: {
          colors: true,
          reasons: true,
          modules: true,
      },
  };
  ```

- After running Webpack, check the output in the terminal to see how large your bundle is compared to your original JavaScript files.

### 4. **Check Browser Console for Warnings/Errors**

While testing, keep an eye on the **Console** tab for any warnings or errors. This can indicate if there are any issues with the way assets are loaded, which could impact performance.

### 5. **Use Real User Monitoring (RUM)**

If you plan to deploy your app and want ongoing performance monitoring, consider integrating tools like:

- **Google Analytics** with performance tracking
- **New Relic** or **Sentry** for detailed performance metrics and error tracking

### Summary

By following these steps, you can effectively measure the speed benefits of using Webpack in your Django app. You'll be able to see improvements in load times and understand the impact of bundling and optimizing your assets. If you have any specific questions about the testing process or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
